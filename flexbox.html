          The night before I stayed at the Backpackers Inn. At daybreak, the
          supervisor of Gamli Skoli picked me up to take me via ferry to the
          island.

          The wind, the ever changing colors of the early evening skies, the
          rock formations along the coast and of course the Fjölls were the
          inspirations for my paintings.
